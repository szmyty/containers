# Docker Compose Network Configuration
# @File: network.yml
# @Author: Alan Szmyt
# @Description: This file defines the network configurations for the Docker
#               Compose setup. It includes settings for the default network
#               using the bridge driver, customized with specific driver
#               options to enhance network performance and connectivity between
#               containers. Labels are used for metadata management, enhancing
#               the discoverability and management of deployed services.
#
# Labels:
#   - app.name: Name of the application or project.
#   - app.env: Deployment environment (development, test, production).
#   - app.version: Current version of the application.
#   - app.description: Brief description of the application.
#   - app.url: URL of the application or project homepage.
#   - app.vendor: Vendor or organization name.
#   - app.license: Licensing information for the application.
#   - app.repository: Repository URL for source code.
#   - app.maintainer: Maintainer contact information.
#   - app.image: Default Docker image used in services.
#   - app.stack: Information about the stack deployment.
#
# Network Settings:
#   - Network Name: Dynamically set based on project name with bridge as the
#       default driver.
#   - IP Masquerade, ICC (Inter Container Communication), and other
#       bridge-specific settings enabled.
#   - Subnet and gateway are defined under IPAM configurations.
#
# Usage:
#   This file should be included in your main docker-compose.yml under
#   networks section to ensure all services can attach to the defined network.
